<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="0" data-line-end="1">RECOMMENDATION\n\n<strong>Verdict: BUY (with a medium-term horizon, accumulate on dips)</strong>\n\n<strong>Rationale:</strong>  \nEMS Limited demonstrates robust fundamentals—strong revenue/profit growth, high ROCE/ROE, and stable margins—supported by management’s confident guidance and a healthy order book. The recent technical correction has brought valuations to more attractive levels, with signs of stabilization and potential for a rebound. Risks exist (cash flow volatility, sector cyclicality), but the risk/reward is favorable for investors seeking growth in the infrastructure/EPC space.\n\n</p>
